## User Background 
Our individual experiences shape us, so write some high-level things about your background here (years of experience with various languages, types of things you usually work on, etc).  This is hugely important for understanding where you're coming from when you analyze the platform. 

## The Sales Pitch
Who's the language designed for? Why do people use it? Give the best sales pitch you can for using this language and framework. If you hate it, just use the official pitch.

## Overall Experience 
Start with your high-level impression. Did it fulfill the pitch? Did you like the language?  Was it fun? Utilitarian? Fast to write? Terrible to get installed? Boring? Was it a good language with a bad framework? Did you keep wishing for X?

## Detail

### Learning and Startup
How was your experience learning the language? Were there lots of materials for newcomers? Is the language easy to understand for someone with your background or is it a totally different paradigm?

### Ease of Coding
How easy was it to translate your implementation idea into the code needed to get it working?

### Joy of Coding
Was it enjoyable to code? Did it make you feel clever to write? Was it full of annoying boilerplate?

### Ease of Reading
How easy was it to read and understand code you wrote last week? How fast can you get to the point of it without having to jump through unnessary layers?

### Magic
How much magic is happening behind the scenes? Were you able to understand how things worked?

### Automated Testing
How easy was automated testing?  Be sure to include the experience of unit testing and mocking out dependencies.

### Dev Tooling
What's the IDE experience like?  How's the available tooling that helps get a developer going? How's the compiler?

### Debugging
How easy or hard was it to find bugs in your code? how's the tooling around debugging?

### Community
How was the community of developers?  If you searched for an answer did you find it was answered well?  Or is it full of unhelpful know-it-alls?  This is MASSIVELY subjective, so please please please try to be unemotional about it.

### Ecosystem
How usable is the ecosystem?  Did you find the libraries you needed?  How's the package system?

### Runtime Performance
How did the runtime performance stack up? Did you have to spend a lot of time optimizing or did it just kinda come out ok? _TODO: We'll need to figure out a way to standardize this_

### Production Tooling
How's the tooling for production? If you had a memory leak in production, could you figure it out? If your service was too slow in production could you tell why? Profilers? Tracers? Loggers? Memory analysis? 

### Cross-Platform
How is the cross-platform experience? Can it easily be written by developers using Macs and Windows to run in production on Linux?

### Standardized
How standard is the code that you found? Are there thousands of right ways to do something in the language or is there one right way? If you find code written by another random developer how likely is it that you're going to be able to read it?

### Other Notes
Anything you think is important that was left out.
