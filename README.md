# Dev Platform Experience
The goals of this project are:
1. To have some nerdy fun
2. To have an excuse to try new dev platforms
3. To centralize experiential knowledge of various dev platforms performing the same tasks.

## How to participate
1. Pick a project from the list below and read the provided specification.
2. Read the [experience report template](template-report.md) to know what type of documentation we're looking for. It's detailed and designed to make you really think about your experience.
3. Select any platform that can meet the specification and implement it.  Keep track of your experience during the entire cycle (including learn, code, test, debug, and release).
4. Write up and submit a new experience report as a pull request. Be sure to fill out every section of the report and place it in the correct directory. Notice the directory strucure group into projects > languages > frameworks > _username_-report.md
